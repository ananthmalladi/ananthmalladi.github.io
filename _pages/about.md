About
=======

I am Ananth Venkatesh Malladi, a theoretical physics graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I grew up in Vermont, and obtained my B.S. in Physics from Caltech in 2022. My current research focuses on using insights from condensed matter in particle phenomenology.

Research Summary
===========
As an undergraduate in Caltech, I had the pleasure of working with Prof. Xie Chen on operator algebras in fracton phases. This is a general method for characterizing the Hilbert space of anyon models, and in particular allowed us to calculate the ground state degeneracy of the Ising cagenet model. 

Currently, I am working in Prof. Nathaniel Craig's group to develop generalized symmetries in the context of particle phenomenology. Stay tuned for spurion analyses for higher-form symmetries!

Other
=============
In my free time, I play lots of badminton and am an avid Indian classical musician.

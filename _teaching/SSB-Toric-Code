type: "JC Talk Notes"

excerpt: "Gauge theories have three main phases: the Higgs phase, the confining phase, and the deconfined phase. All of these can be realized in the toric code, and can be understood in terms of higher-form symmetries. In these notes, I go through this. This was part of a talk that I gave at UCSB's Low Energy Physics Journal Club in January 2024."
